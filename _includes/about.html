        <p>"I’m currently working toward the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, where I’m developing key skills like network security, threat detection, and incident response. I’ve also been gaining hands-on experience with system hardening and firewalls. One of the strengths I bring to cybersecurity is my ability to problem-solve under pressure, which I developed as a Production Coordinator at Kinetic Content. On set, I frequently faced last-minute logistical challenges and had to think on my feet to resolve them. This skill will be invaluable in cybersecurity, where quick decision-making is essential for responding to incidents.

In addition, my communication skills set me apart. At MTV Studios, I regularly coordinated between technical and non-technical teams, ensuring everyone understood their tasks and timelines. This ability to translate technical information clearly will help me provide excellent support in a Help Desk role, especially when working with users who may not have a technical background.

I also pride myself on my attention to detail. Whether managing production schedules or ensuring deliveries at GrubHub were accurate and on time, I’ve always maintained a meticulous approach. In cybersecurity, this attention to detail will be crucial for identifying potential vulnerabilities and ensuring systems are secure.

With my growing technical skills, a customer-focused mindset, and the ability to solve problems and communicate effectively, I’m confident I can make a strong contribution to a cybersecurity team, particularly in a Help Desk role.
